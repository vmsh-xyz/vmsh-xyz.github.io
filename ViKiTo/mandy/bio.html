        <p></font><font size="2"><font face="Verdana">he's just 15 years old...but knew by the age
        of six that she was meant to be on stage.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; She's still in high school (and an honor
        student)...but already is a poised performer of exceptional ability and impressive
        experience. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; She's an outgoing, fun-loving teenager who started
        out &quot;jumping on my bed and singing&quot;...and now looks forward to the release of
        her 550 Music debut album. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; She's <b>Mandy Moore</b>, and here are a few things
        you should know about her: </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Amanda Leigh (Mandy) Moore was born April 10, 1984 in
        Nashua, New Hampshire but two months later moved with her family to Orlando, Florida.
        &quot;O-Town! I really like living here, for the weather and for all the fun things there
        are to do.&quot; Mandy discovered her love of singing when she went to a summer musical
        theater camp when she was nine years old. &quot;My parents thought it was just a phase I'd
        grow out of. But I stuck to it and begged them for acting lessons, for voice
        lessons.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Where did she get her talent? Mandy isn't sure, but
        she has an idea. &quot;It may have come from my grandmother. She was a dancer in the
        theater district of London, the West End.&quot; And in Orlando, Mandy soon became known as
        the &quot;National Anthem Girl.&quot; &quot;Yes, that's me! Some people know me that way
        because they've heard me sing 'The Star-Spangled Banner' for all the major sports teams
        and for Chris Evert's Pro-Celebrity Tennis Tournament.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; National commercials, TV pilots, and voice-overs have
        made Mandy a veteran of the recording studio. &quot;When I first started recording, it was
        hard. My friends didn't understand why I couldn't hang out with them as much. I thought
        they'd talk behind my back or be jealous. But they've become really supportive, and I feel
        blessed by that.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandy likes all kinds of music, especially the songs
        of other female singers like Whitney Houston, Mariah Carey, Lauryn Hill and Madonna. Her
        album reflects the diversity of her taste, from the plaintive ballad &quot;Quit Breakin'
        My Heart&quot; to the alluring &quot;What You Want&quot; to &quot;So Real,&quot; which she
        describes as having &quot;more of a rock edge, with more guitar - a Natalie Imbruglia type
        of song.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Mandy lives in Orlando with her parents, Don and
        Stacy; her brothers Scott (18) and Kyle (13); and their three cats Milo, Zoe, and Chloe.
        Mandy's favorite book is A Land Remembered, her favorite movie is Beaches, her favorite
        actress is Gwyneth Paltrow and her favorite actor is Ryan Philipe. In school, Mandy enjoys
        English and French...but math is a touchy subject! She's also learning to play guitar with
        an eye towards writing her own songs. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;&nbsp; Growing up too fast? Mandy Moore doesn't think so.
        &quot;I don't feel I've missed out on anything about growing up because I feel so
        fortunate. There are so many kids that would love to be doing what I'm doing!&quot;</font></font></td>
