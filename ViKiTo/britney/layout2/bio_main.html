<p><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><small>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performing since early
childhood in local dance reviews and church choirs, she auditioned for the Disney
Channel's &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; series at age eight in Atlanta. Too young for her
series, but too talented to dismiss, a producer on the show helped Britney secure an agent
in New York City, where she spent the next three summers studying at the renowned
Off-Broadway Dance Center and at the Professional Performing Arts School. She also began
appearing in national commercials and Off-Broadway shows including the 1991comedy,
&quot;Ruthless,&quot; based on the 1956 thriller &quot;The Bad Seed.&quot; &quot;At 10 I
was playing this really bad child who seems real sweet but she's evil too. It was so much
fun,&quot; she recalls. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally old enough at age 11, Britney earned a coveted place in
&quot;Mickey Mouse Club.&quot; After two years performing on the popular children's TV
show filmed in Orlando, Britney returned to Kentwood for one completely normal year of
high school at age 14. &quot;It was fun for awhile but I started getting itchy to get out
again<em> </em>and see the world,&quot; she says.</small></font></p>
