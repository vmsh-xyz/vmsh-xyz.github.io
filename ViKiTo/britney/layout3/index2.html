        <small><small>+</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> It seems that the tickets for
        Britney's concerts this summer sell very well, like hot cakes. :) Just read what a Britney
        fan has experienced: &quot;I live in Antioch CA, and Britney is going to be having a
        concert here in Concord on August 1st. I wanted to go, so I went to buy the tickets. As I
        arrived, the line for tickets was out the door! And this wasn't it a small store, it was a
        department store. So, I went home to buy them on the Internet and they were all sold out
        except for lawn seats. It is just amazing how she has so many fans in this small
        city.&quot; - Mandy</font></small></small><p><strong><small><small><font face="Verdana"

        <small><small>+</font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"> It is official Britney's new
        single is called &quot;Opps! I Did it again...&quot; it will hit radio airwaves March27th.
        The song was originally titled &quot;Me...&quot;! She is also doing a cover of an old
        Rolling Stones songcalled &quot;(I Don't Need No) Satisfaction&quot;. She has notrecorded
        &quot;Satisfaction&quot; yet. I know she is going in after the Grammy's and recording and
        mixing it withRodney Jerkins. She also wrote a song herself entitled &quot;Dear
        Diary&quot;. It is about a girl who is inlove with this guy and then comes in and writes
        about it in her diary. It is pretty amazing. I have listened to the entire finished album
        with the exception of a few that will be added, and it is GREAT! I swear. Even though
        Britney did not win any Grammy's this year I know she will next year! I am telling you
        this is awesome! But I would not consider it pop. More like R&amp;B meets pop meets
        Hip-Hop. </small></small><br>
        <small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard this information when I was in Sweden working on my
        album, but you can also hear about some of the same stuff at Mtv.com and Brittney's
        official website Britney.com.</small></small><br>
        <small><small>&nbsp;&nbsp; I also heard that Britney is in talks to star in a movie called
        &quot;The President's Daughter&quot;. All I know about this one is that it is about a
        naughty firstkid. She talks some about that in the issue of People magazine with her on
        the cover. She is also set tostar along side Ben Afleck if she gets the part. You can find
        out more info about the project itself by clicking over to <a
        href="http://www.darkhorizons.com/news.htm" target="_blank">http://www.darkhorizons.com/news.htm</a>
        and looking under a news submition entitled ROGERKUMBLE'S NEXT. Well I just wanted to let
        you Britney fans know about that! And don't forget to wait for my CD
        called&quot;Supernova&quot; to come out in stores sometime in the latesummer! - sudmitted
