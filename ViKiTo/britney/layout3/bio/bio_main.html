    Spears enjoys being a girl. She loves colors that pop and shopping till you drop, romance
    novels and idyllic days at the beach. Untamed and untarnished as they come, the bright
    beautiful teen from Kentwood, Louisiana (pop:1200), is poised to liven up the pop world
    with the irresistible collection of songs on her Jive Records self-titled debut release.<br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Produced by Eric Foster White (Whitney Houston, Hi-Five) and Max Martin
    (Robyn, Backstreet Boys, Ace of Base), the album showcases Britney's unbridled
    effervescence and musical curiosity. From the sweet melody of &quot;From the Bottom of My
    Broken Heart,&quot; to the driving funk of &quot;One More Time,&quot; to the funky reggae
    beats of &quot;Soda Pop,&quot; to her soulful take on the Jets hit &quot;You've Got It
    All,&quot; Britney's lively, assured vocal style is intoxicating. &quot;I want to be an
    artist that everyone can relate to, that's young, happy and fun,&quot; she says. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Despite a refreshingly adolescent attitude, Britney's life has hardly been
    traditional. &quot;I've done the prom thing, but it's only once a year,&quot; she notes
    about her unconventional teenage lifestyle. &quot;I need to sing and I love to
    travel.&quot; <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Performing since early childhood in local dance reviews and church choirs,
    she auditioned for the Disney Channel's &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; series at age eight
    in Atlanta. Too young for her series, but too talented to dismiss, a producer on the show
    helped Britney secure an agent in New York City, where she spent the next three summers
    studying at the renowned Off-Broadway Dance Center and at the Professional Performing Arts
    School. She also began appearing in national commercials and Off-Broadway shows including
    the 1991 comedy, &quot;Ruthless,&quot; based on the 1956 thriller &quot;The Bad
    Seed.&quot; &quot;At 10 I was playing this really bad child who seems real sweet but she's
    evil too. It was so much fun,&quot; she recalls. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Finally old enough at age 11, Britney earned a coveted place in &quot;Mickey
    Mouse Club.&quot; After two years performing on the popular children's TV show filmed in
    Orlando, Britney returned to Kentwood for one completely normal year of high school at age
    14. &quot;It was fun for awhile but I started getting itchy to get out again and see the
    world,&quot; she says. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; A devoted fan of pop music- her favorites include Michael Jackson, Mariah
    Carey, and Whitney Houston- Britney once again went to New York to pursue her dream.
    &quot;I had always wanted to be a singer,&quot; she says. &quot;It's what I always wanted
    to do since I was little.&quot; Now a seasoned performer at age 15, an audition for an all
    girl vocal group led to her developing a solo career as a pop singer as well as continuing
    her high school studies with tutors. &quot;I need a lot of help in geometry and
    Spanish!&quot; she admits. <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp; Recording with Martin in Sweden this past spring and in New Jersey with
    Foster White, Britney's ready to make her own special mark on the world. &quot;I love
    performing more than anything and having people hear my music. I know I've had to give
    some stuff up to do this, but I don't miss high school. When I was home two years ago,
    every weekend we'd go out and do the same thing. It's wonderful as long as you love what
    you're doing, but I'd rather be doing this!&quot;</font></td>
