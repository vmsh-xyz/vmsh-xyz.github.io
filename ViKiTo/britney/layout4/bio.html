            &nbsp; princesses and fame. Although it sounds strange to many people, here is the story

            align="right"><small><small>she was just an ordinary girl. Born in Kentwood, Louisiana on
            the 2nd of December, 1981, Britney Jean Spears was the second child to her parents. Little
            Britney was too active for a small child and that was the reason for her parents to decide
            that she has to take dance lessons - to release all the energy she had. So the future star
            performed in local dance reviews and church choirs for several years. When Britney was 8,
            she auditioned for the Disney Channel's &quot;Mickey Mouse Club&quot; series in Atlanta.
            But she was said to be too young for the series. Britney was disappointed and did not know
            what to do.<br>

            </font><u><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><strong>THE CHANCE</strong></font></u><font
            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            Although she was too young for the series, one of the producers of &quot;Mickey Mouse
            Club&quot; found Britney very talanted and decided to help her. </small></small><img
            src="images/bio_britney_mmc.gif" width="132" height="112" align="left"><small><small>He
            secured her an agent from New York City and she worked there for almost three years.
            Little Britney studied at the renowned&nbsp; Off-Broadway Dance Center and at the
            Professional Performing Arts&nbsp; School. Also she took part in the Off-Broadway show
            &quot;Ruthless,&quot; a comedy based on the 1956 thriller &quot;The Bad Seed.&quot; This
            was in 1991, Britney was just 10 and she had to play the cute but evil child. Later in
            1992 she appeared for two times on the &quot;Star Search&quot; show - the first time as a
            winner and next time as a looser. But this time Britney was not disappointed - she was
            stronger and knew that there is still time to be an absolute winner. During next year
            Britney also took part in several TV commercials. Everything seemed to be all right - she
            finally had what she had been waiting for since she was a little kid. She was performing
            on stage - singing, dancing and acting - and was living in New York City. But as every
            child - no matter how much talanted or ambicious - Britney missed home. She missed her
            Dad, her school, her friends. And her mother decided that it was time for them to go back
            home.<br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><u><strong>A DREAM COMES TRUE</strong></u></font><font
            face="Verdana" color="#004000"> <br>
            But this was not the end of her career. In 1994 the producers of&nbsp; &quot;Mickey Mouse
            Club&quot; called back and invited Britney to start performing. She was one of the
            youngest members of the crew but it did not bother her. For two years she shared the stage
            with Justin and JC (*NSync), Christina Aguilera and other children, learnt a lot about
            performing and working hard. Although the success of the show it was stopped and Britney
            had to go back home. Again. <br>
            <br>
            </font><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF"><u><strong>BRITNEY GETS ITCHY</strong></u></font><font
            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            If such a child as Britney has to live a normal life it seems almost impossible. But she
            tried hard not to think about performing career and focused on studies and normal teenage
            life. Of course, it was crazy to&nbsp; even think for a moment that Britney could do it.
            And she could not. Soon she got itchy and bored of this ordinary life. Her mother called
            her ex-agent from New York City and he offered Britney to take part in the all-girl band
            &quot;Innocence&quot;. She was not flatterred to be part of such a group and turned down
            the offer. Thed Britney recorded a demo-tape and her mother decided to send it to a
            producer they met earlier in New Your City. The producer worked for &quot;Jive
            Records&quot;.<br>
            <br>
            </font><u><strong><font face="Verdana" color="#FFFFFF">THE STORY REPEATS</font></strong></u><font
            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            No doubt Britney was talanted and deserved a solo career as a singer.&nbsp; She was sent
            to Sweden to record her debut album. &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;&nbsp; was recorded
            parallely in Sweden with Max Martin and in New Jersey with&nbsp; Foster White. Britney had
            to learn a lot about singing and recording techniques but her curiosity and willingness
            helped her to do the impossible. At that time European pop music was conquered by two
            other teenage sensations - Billie and Robyn, but what the producers were looking for was a
            world teenage pop sensation. Britney was told to be the one. It seemed that she had the
            potential and desire to do it. No later than December 1998 &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;
            - the single and the album hit the world charts. A miracle has happened.<br>

            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            No one has ever expected such a success. But no matter what, it happened Britney first
            single and album named &quot;Baby One More Time&quot; hit #1 simultaneosly and this was to
            happen for the first time in music history. The music video, directed by Nagel Dick won
            several prestigious awards, including the award for Best Video on the </small></small><img
            src="images/bio_britney_baby.gif" width="106" height="106" align="right"><small><small>European
            Music Awards in 1999. Next single &quot;Sometimes&quot; just continued the successful path
            of the album. &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot; was the leading single for the teenage
            comedy &quot;Drive Me Crazy&quot; and made a huge success with the several different
            versions of the video featuring the two main actors from the movie. Also Britney made the
            &quot;Time Out with Britney Spears&quot; home video including backstage interview, making
            of the first three videos, live performances and the full lenght videos for &quot;Baby One
            More Time&quot;, &quot;Sometimes&quot; and &quot;(You Drive Me) Crazy&quot;. The next
            thing to come was the new single. But Britney did it the way she love it - surprising once
            again everyone. Actually there were two new singles - special release for Europe,
            &quot;Born to Make You Happy&quot; and special release for the USA, &quot;From the Bottom
            of My Broken Heart&quot;. And, of course, two different single CDs, two different videos
            and two different Britneys - the way the Europeans and the Americans like her. No matter
            the fact that there were two singles, both of them hit #1 in the charts and proved once
            again that Britney deserved all the attention she was paid to. Magazines, newspapers, TV
            channels, sites on the Internet - everyone loved Britney! Numerous live appearances,
            photoshoots, covers of prestigious magazines are already an ordinary part of Britney's
            life. She performed over a hundred sold-out concerts in the USA and was ready the conquer
            Europe and the rest of the world. Everyone believed that she could do it.<br>

            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            It was not long until new Britneys appeared. Producers discovered Christina Aguilera,
            Mandy Moore, Jessica Simpson and many other girls that are trying to sing, dance and look
            like Britney. But miracles does not happen every day. Some of them sing well, others are
            trying to dance and the rest just want to look good. Although the attacks of the newly
            born teen stars, Britney continued to be the one and only princess of teen pop and teen
            hearts. Rumours are the next &quot;best&quot; thing about being a star. Breast implants,
            boyfriends, love affairs, her virginity, the too sexy look for a teenager, claims for not
            willing to perform without lipsinging are just a part of the madness, created by people
            who do not like Britney. In spite of all these gossips she stayed the same grounded girl
            who thinks that rumours in showbiz are something normal. We still do not know many things
            about Britney but we know enough to like her.<br>

            face="Verdana" color="#004000"><br>
            In December 1999, just an year after the release of the &quot;Baby One More Time&quot;
            album, was announced that Britney was </small></small><img
            src="images/bio_britney_oops.gif" width="104" height="100" align="left"><small><small>already
            working on a second album. April 2000 the new single was released and later in May - the
            new album. Both of them were called &quot;Oops... I Did It Again&quot; and debuted as #1
            in the world charts. Britney is wiser and more confident and self-assured; also sexy,
            sassy and solidly in control. The album beat the first-week-sales record for female artist
            with over a million copies of the album sold. Also a book was published, named &quot;Heart
            to Heart&quot;, about the relationship between Britney and her mother Lynn. Britney
            definately did it again! Her two next steps are the world tour and her new single named
            &quot;Lucky&quot;. Looking forward to hearing from her!</small></small></font></td>
