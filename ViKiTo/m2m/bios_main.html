    both five years old in a small town just outside of Oslo, Norway. It wasn't long before
    they started singing and dancing together. A few years later they both acted in musicals
    like Annie, The Sound of Music, Bugsy Malone and the Wizard of Oz. After a while Marion
    and Marit figured out that we wanted to do something by ourselves.</small></small></font><p><font
    face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>To make a long story short, they got a record
    deal and released a children's record (Norwegian songs for kids) in 1994. The record did
    pretty well, (actually it got nominated for the best children's record of the year at the
    Norwegian Grammy awards) and M2M's got the opportunity to perform on several TV shows,
    festivals, and radio programs. They had a lot of fun and were convinced that this was what
    they wanted to do with their lives!</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>When they went into the studio a year
    later to record another children's album, Marion and Marit realized that they wanted to do
    something different. they wanted to take the next step, and they started practicing guitar
    and piano, and began writing pop songs together. They wrote lyrics in English so more
    people could understand our message.</small></small></font></p>
    <p><font face="Arial" color="#FFFFFF"><small><small>One of their demos ended up at
    Atlantic Records in the summer of '98 and they got a worldwide deal! Since then, they've
    been traveling worldwide in order to complete our first recording. They've been fortunate
    that some of the best songwriters and producers in the world have heard their music and
    voices, and to great delight, have wanted to work with them. &quot;Shades of Purple&quot;
    is the result of a lot of hard work (and tons of fun!!!).</small></small></font></p>
