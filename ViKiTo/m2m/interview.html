    have. We went by the name M&amp;M before (Marit and Marion), but that's used by both the

    <em><small><small>Comparing our own music to another band is really hard, but there are
    similarities to the bands we admire. Since Marion plays keyboards and Marit plays guitar
    there's a lot of both in our music. It's hard to put our own music in a special group, but
    we guess you would call it pop. Some people have compared our music to a cross between
    Hanson and TLC.</small></small></em></font></td>

    into guitar-players such as Eric Clapton. I guess you are inspired by everything you hear
    along the road, and you just kinda have to choose what you keep with you.<br>
    Marion - I am inspired by performers like Madonna and Cher, since they have been doing it
    for so long and are still on top of the charts with good music. I also like the voice of
    Celine Dion very much, she's taught me a lot. I also like groups who are themselves, write

    the song is about this boy I met. The song shows that young people also can fall in love.
    I was sitting in my room studying for a history test and was so bored I started writing
    the song instead.<br>
    Marit - I think the first song we ever wrote together was a melody we both played on piano
